# Automatic_fire_detection_CNN
This project uses a CNN-based AI system to detect fire in server rooms using camera input. It includes training a model on a fire dataset and deploying it to detect flames in real-time or from images, triggering an actuator response. The system is designed for integration with autonomous drones.
